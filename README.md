## Lab 2

Change an implementation of the SMO algorithm for Support Vectors to a class in our object-oriented framework. You will test this implementation by running it on some synthetic, linearly-separable data.

Edit the code in https://github.com/pbharrin/machinelearninginaction3x/blob/master/Ch06/svmMLiA.py
to let it fit into a larger framework, and apply to synthetic and linearly separable data

run the test_svm_basic.py to see the result
